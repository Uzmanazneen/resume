    <p>Myself Uzma Nazneen, born in Feb 1993 in a district named Mahaboobnagar located in Telangana district. I have
        completed my studies till Intermediate in Mahaboobnagar district itself and shifted to Hyderabad to complete my
        graduation.I've graduated in Electronics and Communication Engineering from MVSR Engineering college in 2014 and
        Post graduated from MJCET in 2016 with specialization as Digital Systems. In Jan 2017, I joined as an Assistant
        Professor, ECE Dept, in Bhoj Reddy Enginnering College for Women. Ive worked there for nearly 5 years and gained
        a lot of experience and respect too. I've resigned from the post in Dec,2021 due to some personal reasons.
        Currently, Alhamdulillah, Ive recovered from all my personal issues and looking forward to great opportunities
        in my career as well as religion. In Sha Allah.</p>
